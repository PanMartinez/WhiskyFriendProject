# WhiskyFriendProject
My Django Project. 

My idea was, to create simple app that gather whisky lovers.
It's made from two sections:
First one is for the bottles of whisky. As registered, and logged user, You can order sample of whisky from avaliable bottles.
App shows bottles, and also, how much of a whisky left it a bottle. 
Second part (Slainte) is a place, where registered users can comment, and shares their opinions. It's very similar to twitter.

I wanted to train myself with Django in this project.
It's still unfinished, but I will come back to this one day :)
